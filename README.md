# ⚡ EKPC Load Forecasting using Bidirectional LSTM

An advanced deep learning-based electricity load forecasting system developed using **TensorFlow, Bidirectional LSTM, and Streamlit**.
This project predicts next-hour electricity demand using historical load patterns and time-series forecasting techniques.

# Project Overview

Electricity demand forecasting is critical for:

- Power system planning
- Load balancing
- Energy optimization
- Grid stability
- Smart energy management

This project uses a **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)** neural network to accurately forecast electricity load based on historical consumption data.
The system also includes a professional **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time forecasting and visualization.

# Deep Learning Architecture

The forecasting model uses:

- Bidirectional LSTM Layers
- Dense Neural Layers
- Dropout Regularization
- Adam Optimizer
- EarlyStopping

📊 Feature Engineering

The model was trained using:

- Historical Load Values (EKPC_MW)
- Rolling Mean (24 Hours)
- Cyclical Hour Encoding (Hour_sin, Hour_cos)
